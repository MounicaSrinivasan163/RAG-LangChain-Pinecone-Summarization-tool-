# 📘 Book Search, Summarization & Evaluation (RAG System)

## 🧩 Problem Definition

In many real-world scenarios, users need to quickly search through large volumes of documents (books, reports, PDFs, notes) and obtain concise, meaningful summaries of relevant content. Traditional keyword-based search fails to capture semantic meaning and does not provide synthesized answers.

This project solves the problem by building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that:
- Semantically indexes documents
- Retrieves the most relevant chunks for a user query
- Generates a concise summary using an LLM
- Evaluates summary quality using ROUGE metrics

The system is designed to be **persistent, scalable, and production-aligned**, where indexed documents remain searchable across sessions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable semantic search over uploaded documents
- Avoid duplicate indexing using content hashing
- Generate query-focused summaries
- Evaluate summaries using automatic and human evaluation
- Build an industry-grade RAG pipeline with clean modular design

---

## 🧪 Functional Requirements

- Upload and chunk multiple document types (PDF, TXT, CSV, DOCX)
- Generate embeddings and store them in a vector database
- Deduplicate content before indexing
- Perform semantic similarity search
- Generate summaries using an LLM
- Evaluate summaries using ROUGE scores
- Persist indexed data across sessions

## 🧠 System Architecture & Approach

### 1️⃣ Document Ingestion
- Documents are uploaded via Streamlit UI
- Each document is split into overlapping chunks
- Each chunk is hashed using **SHA-256** to create a stable ID

### 2️⃣ Deduplicated Indexing
- Before indexing, Pinecone is checked for existing chunk IDs
- Duplicate chunks are skipped automatically
- New chunks are embedded and upserted in batches

### 3️⃣ Semantic Retrieval
- User query is embedded
- Top-K similar chunks are retrieved from Pinecone
- Retrieval works even if indexing is not done in the current session

### 4️⃣ Summarization
- Retrieved chunks are normalized safely
- Combined context is sent to the LLM
- Summary length is controlled by user input

### 5️⃣ Evaluation
- Generated summaries are evaluated using ROUGE metrics
- Manual human evaluation guidelines are also provided

## 🧠 Design Decisions (Why This Approach)

- **Vector DB (Pinecone)**: Enables scalable semantic search
- **Hash-based IDs**: Prevents duplicate embeddings
- **Chunking with overlap**: Preserves semantic continuity
- **Session-independent retrieval**: Aligns with real-world RAG systems
- **Modular architecture**: Easy to extend or replace components
