2025-12-20T20:54:49.448316,What is machine learning?,"Machine learning enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming, improving predictions over time. Supervised learning uses labeled data for training, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Proper train-test splits prevent overfitting, where models memorize training data but fail on new data. Balancing bias and variance is crucial to avoid underfitting or overfitting, ensuring good generalization to unseen data.",Machine learning is the field of study that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.,2,4,4,4,3,average content
2025-12-21T04:36:05.168372,What is machine learning?,"The content covers key machine learning concepts: overfitting (model memorizes noise) and underfitting (model too simple), generalization (performance on unseen data), and data leakage (using future or test info during training). It explains bias-variance tradeoff, curse of dimensionality, cross-validation types, feature engineering, selection, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization. It also discusses scaling, encoding, ensemble learners, KNN parameter effects, evaluation metrics, and anomaly detection.",Machine learning is the field of study that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.,3,3,3,3,3,very vague definition
2025-12-21T04:38:01.242042,What is unsupervised learning?,"Unsupervised learning involves analyzing unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns without guidance, useful for exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and anomaly detection. Key techniques include K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE, and Isolation Forest. Challenges include evaluation difficulty and sensitivity to parameters. Popular Python libraries are scikit-learn, seaborn, and yellowbrick. It aids preprocessing and understanding complex data structures.",,4,4,5,4,4,Good generation
2025-12-21T05:30:42.273241,what is PCA? ,"PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of its variance (information). It works by:

- Standardizing the data.
- Computing the covariance matrix.
- Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Selecting top principal components that capture the most variance.
- Projecting the original data onto these components.

This results in a simplified dataset with fewer dimensions but maximum retained information.",,5,4,4,5,5,very neat crisp generation
