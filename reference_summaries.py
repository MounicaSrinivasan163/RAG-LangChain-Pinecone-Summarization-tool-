EVAL_QUESTIONS = {
    "What is machine learning?":
        "Machine learning is the field of study that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.",

    "Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning":
        "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabeled data.",

    "What is linear regression?":
        "Linear regression models the relationship between input variables and a continuous output by fitting a straight line that minimizes prediction error.",

    "What is overfitting and underfitting?":
        "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture patterns, while overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data and fails to generalize.",

    "What is the perceptron algorithm?":
        "The perceptron is a binary classification algorithm that learns a linear decision boundary by adjusting weights based on misclassified points.",

    "What is logistic regression?":
        "Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that models probabilities using the logistic function and outputs class labels.",

    "How do we evaluate classification models?":
        "Classification models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.",

    "What is Naive Bayes?":
        "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of feature independence.",

    "What are decision trees?":
        "Decision trees split data using a sequence of questions to reach decisions, making them interpretable and versatile models.",

    "What is ensemble learning?":
        "Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness."
